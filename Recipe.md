After you have brought all the ingredients, crush the oreos into small pieces and put them in a bowl. Pour milk inside the bowl and add little milk made for it to give a good taste. After adding milkmade, stir the the solution till it becomes something like an oreo milkshake. Then add some sugar and stir it more. Finally, put it in the freezer and don't disturb it for 5 hours. Then, take the ice cream out and if you want you can add some cream to it. 
That was a long wait, right? even I thought so when I did it. But when you taste the icecream you will get to know that your effort was paid of.
